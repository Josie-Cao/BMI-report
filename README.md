# Decoding of Monkey Arm Movements: A Study Using kNN and Kalman Filters
This study investigates the decoding of a monkey’s arm
movement trajectories using neural spike data. We evaluated four decoding models: Linear Discriminant Analysis
(LDA), k-nearest Neighbour (kNN), Linear Regression
(LR), and Kalman Filter, to identify the most effective
method. The evaluation involved a detailed performance
analysis using root mean squared error (RMSE) with
respect to the actual movement trajectories. Among the
models tested, the kNN and Kalman filters performed the
best, achieving an RMSE of 15.51cm and runtime of 17.62
seconds.
